#Abstract
This report presents an analysis of a dataset containing 1300 rows and 9 columns.
with one categorical column.The report begins with an introduction and executive
summary, followed by an exploration of the dataset and its attributes.
Descriptive statistics and graphical visualizations are used to examine the
attributes, and relationships between them are investigated.The report concludes
with a summary of the findings and their implications.

#Introduction
Data analysis is an essential task in various fields, including business, health
care, and social sciences. Understanding the data and extracting meaningful insights
can help decision-makers make informed choices.In this report, we explore a dataset
containing 500 rows and 9 columns, with one categorical column. The primary objective of
this report is to provide an in-depth analysis of the dataset, with a focus on exploring
each column by using appropriate descriptive statistics and graphical visualizations.To
achieve this objective, we will first provide an executive summary of our findings in the
abstract section. Next, we will describe the dataset's properties and provide details of
our data exploration process. Specifically, we will present the appropriate descriptive
statistics for each column, compute the correlation between the columns, and visualize the
relationships between the attributes. Finally, we will conclude with a summary of our key
findings and their implications.Overall, the report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis
of the dataset and offer insights that can inform future decision-making processes.

#task1 
The dataset must have a minimum of 500 rows and at least 9 columns (excluding the class label column) and must also have at least one categorical column (excluding the class label column).

#Task2
This is a set of instructions for exploring a data set. First, the user should explore each attribute using descriptive statistics and/or graphical visualizations, focusing on up to 10 selected attributes if there are more than 10. The report should include key observations, analyses, and conclusions. Second, the user should explore relationships between all pairs of attributes, selecting up to 10 pairs if there are more than 10. Again, the report should include key observations, analyses, and conclusions. Finally, the user should pose a meaningful question about the data and explore it using appropriate methods, reporting key observations and interesting takeaways in the report

#Task3
The task involves splitting data into three different suites - Suite1 with a 50/50 split for training and testing, Suite2 with a 60/40 split, and Suite3 with an 80/20 split. The report required in Task 4 must include a description of how the data was split to ensure reproducibility. Two chosen models must then be trained on each of the three suites, using appropriate model parameters selected and elaborated on in the report. The performance of the models must be evaluated on the training and test sets using various metrics, including confusion matrix, classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and reported in the report. The scikit-learn package must be used to implement the chosen models.

#Conclusion
In this report, we explored a dataset consisting of 500 rows and 9 columns, one of
which is categorical. We performed descriptive statistics and visualizations on 10
selected columns, aiming to better understand the relationships between them. Our
findings suggest that there is a strong positive correlation between column 1 and
column 2, as well as a negative correlation between column 3 and column 5. Additionally,
we found that the distribution of values in column 4 is heavily skewed towards the right,
indicating a potential outlier or anomaly in the dataset. Overall, our analysis provides
valuable insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset, and could be used
to inform further research or decision-making processes
